    # CakePHP RocketChatNotification Plugin

The **RocketChatNotification** plugin allows you to send notifications to RocketChat via incoming webhooks using the CakePHP Notification plugin. RocketChat is a free, open-source team collaboration platform that provides features like instant messaging, file sharing, and video conferencing.

The plugin provides simple webhook-based integration with RocketChat, rich message formatting with attachments, fields, and images, support for multiple RocketChat instances, and a fluent API for building complex messages. It includes full integration with CakePHP's Notification system.

The plugin uses the CakePHP HTTP client with no external dependencies, provides full type safety with PHPStan Level 8 compliance, and includes comprehensive test coverage.
